# Bachelor Thesis
The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) will be the largest liquid scintillator-based neutrino detectors in the World, for the next decade. Thanks to its large active mass (20 kt) and state of the art performances (3\% effective energy resolution at 1 MeV), it will be able to perform important measurements in neutrino physics. The proposed thesis will study the application of different Machine Learning inspired algorithms for the discrimination of signal events (interactions of anti-neutrinos coming from the nearby nuclear power plants) from background events.
