   The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) will be the largest liquid scintillator-based neutrino detectors in the World, for the next decade. Thanks to its large active mass (20 kt) and state of the art performances (3\% effective energy resolution at 1 MeV), it will be able to perform important measurements in neutrino physics. This study focuses on improving the event selection performance in JUNO by applying a machine learning techniques, specifically Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Neural Networks (NN), to discriminate between signal events, that are interactions of anti-neutrinos coming from the nearby nuclear power plants from uncorrelated background events.
   The BDT model demonstrated exceptional performance in event classification, achieving high precision and accuracy in distinguishing between signal events and background events. It achieved a remarkably low number of misclassifications, by surpassing the number of misclassified events by the Manual Cut, the current state-of-the-art for classification.
   The Neural Network model also exhibited strong performance, with a slightly higher number of misclassifications compared to BDT. However, it showcased a notable capability to accurately identify signal events while maintaining a relatively low number of misclassifications for background events.
