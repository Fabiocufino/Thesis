\section{Neutrinos Oscillation}
The Standard Model of elementary particle interactions provides an accurate description of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, but it treats these interactions as distinct and unrelated. Within this framework, neutrinos are assumed to be massless, but this assumption has been called into question by physicists. Neutrino oscillations, which occur when neutrinos change from one flavor to another, are a potential indication of neutrino mass.\\
The term "neutrino oscillations" refers to this phenomena and it involve the conversion of a neutrino of a particular flavor to another as it propagates through space.

Each known flavor eigenstate, $(\nu_e,\nu_{\mu},\nu_{\tau})$, linked to three respective charged leptons $(e,\mu,\tau)$  via the charged current interactions can be considered a complex combination of neutrino mass eigenstates as follow:

\begin{equation*}
	\left(\begin{array}{l}
		v_e \\
		v_\mu \\
		v_\tau
	\end{array}\right)=U_{\mathrm{PMNS}}\left(\begin{array}{l}
		v_1 \\
		v_2 \\
		v_3
	\end{array}\right)
\end{equation*}
in wich $\nu_i$ are the three mass eigensates, that have 3 masses  $m_i$  $(i = 1,2,3)$, which are non-degenerate, with $m_i \neq m_j$ for $i \neq j$.\\

The matrix $U_{\mathrm{PMNS}}$, called Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, is composed of three rotation matrices, $R_{23}$, $R_{13}$, and $R_{12}$, each corresponding to a different mixing angle, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$, and $\theta_{12}$, respectively and a parameter $\delta_{CP}$ called the Dirac CP-violating phase. For this case, the Majorana $C P$ phases are $eta i(i=1,2)$, which are only physically possible if neutrinos are Majorana-type particles and do not participate in neutrino oscillations. Therefore, $U$ can be expressed as:

\begin{equation*} 
	\begin{split}
			U_{\text {PMNS }}&=\\
		=&\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
			1 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\
			0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}
		\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
			c_{13} & 0 & s_{13} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} \delta_{C P}} \\
			0 & 1 & 0 \\
			-s_{13} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \delta_{C P}} & 0 & c_{13}
		\end{array}\right) 
		\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
			c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\
			-s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 1
		\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
			\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \eta_1} & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \eta_2} & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 1
		\end{array}\right)
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The theoretical framework for neutrino oscillations involves the calculation of the oscillation probability as a function of the distance traveled by the neutrino, the neutrino mixing matrix, and the difference in squared masses between the three neutrino mass states, $\Delta m_{ij}^2$. Specifically,two nuclear power reactors 53 $\unit{\kilo\meter}$ away from the detector, which mostly produce anti-electron neutrinos $\bar{\nu}_e$ with energy below 10 MeV, are the principal sources of neutrinos for the JUNO experiment. So, it is necessary for the JUNO experiment to calculate the survival probability $P\left(\bar{\nu}_e \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e\right)$ of electron antineutrinos.

\begin{equation*}
	P\left(\bar{\nu}_e \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e\right)=1-\sin ^2 2 \theta_{12} c_{13}^4 \sin ^2\left(\frac{\Delta m_{21}^2 L}{4 \mathcal{E}}\right)-\sin ^2 2 \theta_{13}\left[c_{12}^2 \sin ^2\left(\frac{\Delta m_{31}^2 L}{4 \mathcal{E}}\right)+s_{12}^2 \sin ^2\left(\frac{\Delta m_{32}^2 L}{4 \mathcal{E}}\right)\right]
\end{equation*}

where $s_{i j} \equiv \sin \theta_{i j}, c_{i j} \equiv \cos \theta_{i j}, \mathcal{E}$ is the neutrino energy, $L$ the travelled distance and $\Delta m_{i j}^2 \equiv m_i^2-m_j^2$. \\
Past experiments have already given estimates for  $\Delta m_{21}^2,\left|\Delta m_{31}^2\right|$ and the  3 mixing angles.

The aim of JUNO is then to improve these results, and especially fix the sign of $\Delta m_{31}^2$ by discriminating between two possibilities:\textit{ Normal Ordering} (\textbf{NO}), where $\left|\Delta m_{31}^2\right|=\left|\Delta m_{32}^2\right|+\left|\Delta m_{21}^2\right|$, and if $m_1<m_2<m_3$ we have the so called \textit{ Inverted Ordering} (\textbf{IO}), where $\left|\Delta m_{31}^2\right|=\left|\Delta m_{32}^2\right|-\left|\Delta m_{21}^2\right|$, and $m_3<m_1<m_2$.
In fact, depending on the sign of $\Delta m_{31}^2$, the plot of \ref{fig:antineutinotoantineutrinoprobabilityplot} is minimally different.


\section{The JUNO detector}

The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an experiment that is currently under construction in Southern China, in Jinji town, 43 km to the southwest of Kaiping city. This multipurpose experiment is expected to detect a large number of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors, with most of them originating from the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants (NPPs). These two plants are located at a baseline of about 52.5 km from the JUNO detector, which was optimized for the best sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, and have a combined nominal thermal power of 26.6 $GW_{th}$. JUNO requires knowledge of the unoscillated reactor antineutrino spectrum shape, which is why a specialized small detector named TAO will be situated approximately 30 meters from one of the Taishan reactors to precisely measure it. The data collected by TAO will serve as a data-driven input to restrict the spectra of the other reactor cores.\\


The JUNO detector comprises three main components, namely the Central Detector (CD), a water Cherenkov detector, and a Top Tracker (TT). The CD is a liquid scintillator (LS) detector, featuring an effective energy resolution of $\sigma_E/E =3\% / \sqrt{E (MeV)}$. It is composed of a 20 kton LS, enclosed within a spherical acrylic vessel, submerged in a water pool, that has a diameter of 43.5 m and a height of 44 m, providing sufficient buffer in all directions to protect the LS from the surrounding rock radioactivity. The water pool contains PMTs, which detect the Cherenkov light emitted from cosmic muons, acting as a veto detector.
The vessel is supported by a stainless steel (SS) structure, via Connecting Bars, with CD Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) installed on the inner surface of the SS structure. 
Compensation coils are mounted on the SS structure, aimed at suppressing the Earth's magnetic field and reducing its impact on the photoelectron collection efficiency of the PMTs. 
Atop the water pool lies a Top Tracker, which comprises a plastic scintillator array designed to precisely measure muon tracks. The CD is connected to the outside through a chimney, which facilitates calibration operations. The Calibration House, located above the chimney, contains special radioactivity shielding and a muon detector.\\

A schematic illustrating the location of both JUNO and TAO is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:junoschemeexperiment}.

\section{JUNO signals and backgrounds}
%TODO: Add info about the energy resolution with other terms. Add also the fact that JUNO is segmented, not compact. Add the fact that JUNO is a calorimeter.
\subsection{Signal}
%LIQUID SCINTILLATOR
The scintillator is doped with a small amount of gadolinium to enhance its sensitivity to antineutrinos via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. The liquid scintillator used in JUNO is a combination of LAB (linear alkyl benzene) and PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole) doped with a small amount of bis-MSB (1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl) benzene). When a neutrino interacts with the scintillator, it can produce charged particles such as electrons, protons, and alpha particles that travel through the scintillator and excite the scintillation molecules. This excitation results in the emission of photons with a wavelength of around 430 nm. These photons are detected by 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) distributed in a 3-dimensional arrangement inside the detector.\\




\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\overline{\nu}e + p &\rightarrow e^+ + n \\
		n + ^A_ZX &\rightarrow ^{A}_{Z-1}X^* + \gamma \\
		e^+ + e^- &\rightarrow 2\gamma
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation} =

The PMTs detect the light and convert it into an electrical signal. The signals from all the PMTs are then combined to reconstruct the position and energy of the original neutrino interaction. This technique allows JUNO to measure the energy of the incoming neutrino to high precision, which is crucial for studying neutrino oscillation.

Moreover, the scintillator's composition and the detector's design are optimized to reduce background noise from other sources of radiation, such as cosmic rays and natural radioactivity. By carefully controlling these backgrounds, JUNO aims to achieve a signal-to-background ratio of better than 1:10,000, which is essential for observing the subtle effects of neutrino oscillation.

In JUNO's location, the energy spectrum will be distorted by two types of oscillations. The first is a slow (low frequency) oscillation driven by $\Delta m_{21}^2$ and modulated by $\sin ^2 \theta_{12}$, while the second is a fast (high frequency) oscillation driven by $\Delta m_{31}^2$ and modulated by $\sin ^2 \theta_{13}$. Fitting the data spectrum against the predicted spectrum distorted by standard neutrino oscillations enables measuring the oscillation parameters.\\
\subsection{Background}
Several different types of backgrounds signal are produced in the detector. For analysis we deeply analysed only the three most important contributes:


\paragraph{Radiogenic Backgrounds}

Radiogenic backgrounds arise from decays of radioactive isotopes in detector materials and surrounding rock. These decays can produce various forms of radiation, such as gamma rays and neutrons, which can interact with the detector and produce background events. Examples of radiogenic isotopes include $^{238}\mathrm{U}$, $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$, $^{40}\mathrm{K}$, and their daughter products. The main contributions to the radiogenic backgrounds come from the $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ and $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ decay chains, with a smaller contribution from $^{40}\mathrm{K}$.

\paragraph{Cosmogenic Backgrounds}

Cosmogenic backgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic rays with materials surrounding the detector, such as the atmosphere and the Earth's crust. Muons produced in these interactions can penetrate the detector and produce background events. Specifically they interact with detector materials, producing isotopes such as $^{11}\mathrm{C}$, $^{9}\mathrm{Li}$, and $^{8}\mathrm{He}$, instable atoms which decay and produce additional background events.

\paragraph{Atmospheric Neutrino Backgrounds}

Atmospheric neutrino backgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei with the Earth's atmosphere, which produce a flux of neutrinos that can interact with the detector. These interactions can produce both charged and neutral current events, which can mimic the signal from reactor neutrinos.

\paragraph{Reactor Antineutrino Backgrounds}

Reactor antineutrino backgrounds arise from the neutrinos produced in the nuclear reactors that power the JUNO experiment. These antineutrinos are the main signal for JUNO, but a small fraction of them can interact with the detector in ways that mimic background events. These interactions can produce both charged and neutral current events, which can be difficult to distinguish from the signal.


Here a viasualization sumary of all the bacgrounds contributions:
